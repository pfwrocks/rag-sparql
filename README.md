# RAG with SPARQL Data Tree Search Demo

This is a demonstration project showcasing the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with SPARQL data for tree search. RAG combines retrieval-based models and generative models to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses. In this case, we're utilizing SPARQL data for tree search over structured data.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the RAG-powered tree search demo.

## Usage

In this demo, you can perform tree searches over SPARQL data by inputting queries and receiving relevant responses generated by the RAG model. The system provides accurate and context-aware information retrieval for structured data.
